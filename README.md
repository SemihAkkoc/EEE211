# EEE211
Yeap, I am still lazy but I acknowledge that I should write a readme for this repo as well.

### Disclaimer
During our semester this courses lab work got a lot of revisions so be aware that some figures and values might slightly off due to wrong instructions in the first place.

### Miscellaneous
There is a folder named TRC-11 which contains the working TRC-11 images, and for that, I send my regards to Berkehan Ercan for supplying the photos of the TRC-11.
